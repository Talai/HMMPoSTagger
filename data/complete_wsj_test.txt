Shares

Wall

had
placed
unusually
large

that

would
succeed
and
UAL
stock
would
rise
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
At
2:43
p.m.
EDT
,
came
the
sickening
news
:
The
Big

was
halting
trading
in
UAL
,
``
pending

''
<EOS>
<BOS>
On
the

floor
,
``
as
soon
as

we
braced

said
one
top

trader
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Several
traders
could
be
seen
shaking
their
heads
when
the
news
flashed
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
For
weeks
,
the
market
had
been
nervous
about
takeovers
,
after
Campeau
Corp.
's
cash
crunch
spurred
concern
about
the
prospects
for
future
highly
leveraged
takeovers
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
10
minutes
after
the
UAL
trading
halt
came
news
that
the
UAL
group
could
n't
get
financing
for
its
bid
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
At
this
point
,
the
Dow
was
down
about
35
points
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
market
crumbled
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Arbitragers
could
n't
dump
their
UAL
stock
--
but
they
rid
themselves
of
nearly
every
``
rumor
''
stock
they
had
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
For
example
,
their
selling
caused
trading
halts
to
be
declared
in
USAir
Group
,
which
closed
down
3
7\/8
to
41
1\/2
,
Delta

which
fell

3\/4

and
Philips

which
sank
3

1\/2
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
These
stocks
eventually
reopened
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
as
panic
spread
,
speculators
began
to
sell
blue-chip
stocks
such
as
Philip
Morris
and
International
Business
Machines
to
offset
their
losses
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
When
trading
was
halted
in
Philip

,
the
stock
was
trading
at
41

while
IBM
closed
5

<EOS>
<BOS>
Selling
snowballed
because
of
waves
of
automatic
``
stop-loss
''
orders
,
which
are
triggered
by
computer
when

fall
to
certain
levels
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Most
of

came
from

most

<BOS>
Now
,
at
3:07
,
one
of
the
market
's
post-crash
``

''
took
hold
as
the
S&P
500
futures
contract
had
plunged
12
points

equivalent

<EOS>
<BOS>
Under
an
agreement
signed
by
the

temporarily
halted

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
After
the
trading
halt
in
the
S&P
500
pit
in
Chicago
,
waves
of
selling
continued
to
hit
stocks
themselves
on
the
Big

,
and
specialists
continued
to
notch
prices
down
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
As
a
result
,
the
link
between
the
futures
and
stock
markets
ripped
apart

<EOS>
<BOS>
Without
the
guidepost
of
stock-index
futures
--
the
barometer
of
where

think

many
traders
were
afraid
to
trust
stock
prices
quoted
on
the
Big

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The

halt
was
even
assailed
by

floor
traders
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
It
screwed

up

''
said
one
major
specialist
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
This
confusion
effectively
halted
one
form
of
program
trading
,
stock
index
arbitrage
,
that
closely
links
the

<EOS>
<BOS>
At

p.m.

,
S&P

resumed
trading

and
for

the

started
to
come
back
in
line
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Buyers
stepped

<EOS>
<BOS>
But
the
build-up
of
S&P

sell
orders
weighed
on
the
market
,
and
the
link
with
stocks
began
to
fray
again
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
At
about
3:45
,
the
S&P
market
careened
to
still
another
limit
,
of
30
points
down

and
trading
was
locked
again
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Futures
traders
say
the
S&P
was
signaling
that
the
Dow
could
fall
as
much
as
200

<EOS>
<BOS>
During

time
,
small

began
ringing
their

wondering
whether
another

<EOS>
<BOS>
At

some

That

``

It

Mr.

told

<EOS>
<BOS>
At

the

a

release
was
prepared
headlined
``

The

cautioned
that
``
there
are
significant

that
there
are

However

<EOS>
<BOS>
As
the
Dow
average
ground
to
its
final
190.58

Friday
,
the

stayed
locked
at
its
30-point
trading
limit

<EOS>
<BOS>
Jeffrey
Yass
of
program
trader
Susquehanna

said
2,000
S&P

close

the
equivalent
of
$
330
million
in
stock

<EOS>
<BOS>
But
there
were
no
buyers
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
While
Friday
's
debacle
involved
mainly
professional
traders
rather
than
investors
,
it
left
the
market
vulnerable
to
continued
selling
this
morning
,
traders
said
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Stock-index
futures
contracts
settled
at
much
lower
prices
than
indexes
of
the
stock
market
itself
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
At
those
levels
,
stocks
are
set
up
to
be
hammered
by
index
arbitragers
,
who
lock
in
profits
by
buying
futures
when
futures
prices
fall
,
and
simultaneously
sell
off
stocks
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
nobody
knows
at
what
level
the
futures

stocks
will
open
today
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
de-linkage
between
the
stock
and
futures
markets
Friday
will
undoubtedly
cause
renewed
debate
about
whether
Wall

is
properly
prepared

another
crash
situation

<EOS>

The

Mr.

said
,
``
Our

<EOS>
<BOS>
But

``

L.J.
Hooker
was
a

As

The

Friday

Stock
fund
redemptions
during

1987
debacle
did
n't
begin
to
snowball
until
after

opened
on
Black
Monday
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
fund
managers
say
they
're
ready
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Many
have
raised
cash
levels
,
which
act
as
a
buffer
against
steep
market
declines
.
<EOS>

Mario

<BOS>
Windsor

John

Michael

said
they
had
raised

%
and
30

,
respectively
,
this

Even
Peter
Lynch
,
manager
of
Fidelity
's
$
12.7
billion
Magellan
Fund
,
the
nation
's
largest
stock
fund
,
built
up
cash
to
7
%
or
$
850
million
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
One
reason
is
that
after
two
years
of
monthly
net
redemptions
,
the
fund
posted
net
inflows
of
money
from
investors
in
August
and
September
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
I
've
let
the
money
build
up
,
''
Mr.
Lynch
said
,
who
added
that
he
has
had
trouble
finding
stocks
he
likes
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Not
all
funds
have
raised
cash
levels
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
As
a
group
,
stock
funds
held
10.2
%
of
assets
in
cash
as
of
August
,
the
latest
figures
available
from
the
Investment
Company
Institute
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
That
was
modestly
higher
than
the
8.8
%
and
9.2
%
levels
in
August
and
September
of
1987
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Also
,
persistent
redemptions
would
force
some
fund
managers
to
dump
stocks
to
raise
cash
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
a
strong
level
of
investor
withdrawals
is
much
more
unlikely
this
time
around
,
fund
managers
said
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
major
reason
is
that
investors
already
have
sharply
scaled
back
their
purchases
of
stock
funds
since
Black
Monday
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Stock-fund
sales
have
rebounded
in

Peter

,
vice

,
said
in
an
interview
that
the
work
stoppage
at
Boeing
,
now
entering
its
13th
day
,
``
has
caused
some
turmoil
in

''
and
that
more

500
passengers
who
were
booked
to
fly
out

Houston

would
now
be
put
on

<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.

said
Boeing
told

West
that
the

it
was
supposed
to
get
this

would
n't
be
delivered
until
Nov.

the

the

had
been
planning
to
initiate

at
Houston
with
four
daily

,
including
three
nonstops
to
Phoenix
and
one
nonstop
to
Las

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Now
,
those

are
n't
expected
to
begin

<EOS>
<BOS>
Boeing
is
also
supposed
to
send
to
America
West
another
757
twin-engine
aircraft
as
well
as
a
737
by

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Those
,
too
,
are
almost
certain
to
arrive
late

<EOS>
<BOS>
At
this

,
no
other
America

including
its
new

at
San

Texas

Newark

--
have
been
affected
by
the

in
Boeing

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
company

reaction
underscores
the
domino
effect
that
a
huge
manufacturer
such
as
Boeing
can
have
on
other
parts
of
the
economy
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
also
is
sure
to
help
the
machinists
put
added
pressure
on
the

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
I
just
do

``

<EOS>
<BOS>
America
West
,
though
,
is
a
smaller
airline
and
therefore
more
affected
by
the
delayed
delivery
of
a

than
many
of
its

would
be

<EOS>

``

Indeed

Last

To
a
degree
,
Quantum
represents
the
new
times
that
have
arrived
for
producers
of
the
so-called
commodity
plastics
that
pervade
modern
life
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Having
just
passed
through
one
of
the
most
profitable
periods
in
their
history
,
these
producers
now
see
their
prices
eroding
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Pricing
cycles
,
to
be
sure
,
are
nothing
new
for
plastics
producers
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
the
financial
decline
of
some
looks
steep
only
in

with
the
heady
period
that
is
just

``
We
were
all
wonderful
heroes
last

says
an

at

competitors

``
Now
we

at

''
<EOS>
<BOS>
At
Quantum
,
which
is
based
in
New
York
,
the
trouble
is
magnified
by
the
company
's
heavy
dependence
on
plastics
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Once
known
as
National
Distillers
&
Chemical
Corp.
,
the
company
exited
the
wine
and
spirits
business
and
plowed
more
of
its
resources
into
plastics
after
Mr.
Stookey
took
the
chief
executive
's
job
in
1986
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.
Stookey
,
59
years
old
,
declined
to
be
interviewed
for
this
article
,
but
he
has
consistently
argued
that
over
the
long
haul
--
across
both
the
peaks
and
the
troughs
of
the
plastics
market
--
Quantum
will
prosper
through
its
new
direction
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Quantum
's
lot
is
mostly
tied
to
polyethylene
resin
,
used
to
make
garbage
bags
,
milk
jugs
,
housewares
,
toys
and
meat
packaging
,
among
other
items
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
the
U.S.
polyethylene
market
,
Quantum
has
claimed
the
largest
share
,
about
20
%
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
its
competitors
--
including
Dow
Chemical
Co.
,
Union
Carbide
Corp.
and
several
oil
giants
--
have
much
broader
business
interests
and
so
are
better
cushioned
against
price
swings
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
When
the
price
of
polyethylene
moves
a
mere
penny
a
pound
,
Quantum
's
annual
profit
fluctuates
by
about
85
cents
a
share
,
provided
no
other
variables
are
changing
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
recent
months
the
price
of
polyethylene
,
even
more
than
that
of
other
commodity
plastics
,
has
taken
a
dive
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Benchmark
grades
,
which
still
sold
for
as
much
as
50
cents
a
pound
last
spring
,
have
skidded
to
between
35
cents
and
40
cents
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
price
of
ethylene
,
the
chemical
building
block
of
polyethylene
,
has
n't
dropped
nearly
so
fast
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
That
discrepancy
hurts
Quantum
badly
,
because
its
own
plants
cover
only
about
half
of
its
ethylene
needs
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
By
many
accounts
,
an
early
hint
of
a
price
rout
in
the
making
came
at
the
start
of
this
year
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
China
,
which
had
been
putting
in
huge
orders
for
polyethylene
,
abruptly
halted
them
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Calculating
that
excess
polyethylene
would
soon
be
sloshing
around
the
world
,
other
buyers
then
bet
that
prices
had
peaked
and
so
began
to
draw
down
inventories
rather
than
order
new
product
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Kenneth
Mitchell
,
director
of
Dow
's
polyethylene
business
,
says
producers
were
surprised
to
learn
how
much
inventories
had
swelled
throughout
the
distribution
chain
as
prices
spiraled
up
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
People
were
even
hoarding
bags
,
''
he
says
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Now
producers
hope
prices
have
hit
bottom
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
They
recently
announced
increases
of
a
few
cents
a
pound
to
take
effect
in
the
next
several
weeks
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
No
one
knows
,
however
,
whether
the
new
posted
prices
will
stick
once
producers
and
customers
start
to
haggle
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
One
doubter
is
George
Krug
,
a
chemical-industry
analyst
at
Oppenheimer
&
Co.
and
a
bear
on
plastics
stocks
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Noting
others
'
estimates
of
when
price
increases
can
be
sustained
,
he
remarks
,
``
Some
say
October
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Some
say
November
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
I
say
1992
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
argues
that
efforts
to
firm
up
prices
will
be
undermined
by
producers
'
plans
to
expand
production
capacity
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
quick
turnaround
is
crucial
to
Quantum
because
its
cash
requirements
remain
heavy
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
company
is
trying
to
carry
out
a
three-year
,
$
1.3
billion
plant-expansion
program
started
this
year
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
At
the
same
time
,
its
annual
payments
on
long-term
debt
will
more
than
double
from
a
year
ago
to
about
$
240
million
,
largely
because
of
debt
taken
on
to
pay
a
$
50-a-share
special
dividend
earlier
this
year
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Quantum
described
the
payout
at
the
time
as
a
way
for
it
to
share
the
bonanza
with
its
holders
,
because
its
stock
price
was
n't
reflecting
the
huge
profit
increases
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Some
analysts
saw
the
payment
as
an
effort
also
to
dispel
takeover
speculation
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Whether
a
cash
crunch
might
eventually
force
the
company
to
cut
its
quarterly
dividend
,
raised
36
%
to
75
cents
a
share
only
a
year
ago
,
has
become
a
topic
of
intense
speculation
on
Wall
Street
since
Mr.
Stookey
deflected
dividend
questions
in
a
Sept.
29
meeting
with
analysts
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Some
viewed
his
response
--
that
company
directors
review
the
dividend
regularly
--
as
nothing
more
than
the
standard
line
from
executives
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
others
came
away
thinking
he
had
given
something
less
than
his
usual
straight-from-the-shoulder
performance
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
any
case
,
on
the
day
of
the
meeting
,
Quantum
's
shares
slid
$
2.625
to
$
36.625
in
Big
Board
trading
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
On
top
of
everything
else
,
Quantum
confronts
a
disaster
at
its
plant
in
Morris
,
Ill
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
After
an
explosion
idled
the
plant
in
June
,
the
company
progressed
in
September
to
within
12
hours
of
completing
the
drawn-out
process
of
restarting
it
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Then
a
second
explosion
occurred
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Two
workers
died
and
six
remain
in
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
This
human
toll
adds
the
most
painful
dimension
yet
to
the
sudden
change
in
Quantum
's
fortunes
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Until
this
year
,
the
company
had
been
steadily
lowering
its
accident
rate
and
picking
up
trade-group
safety
awards
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
prolonged
production
halt
at
the
plant
could
introduce
another
imponderable
into
Quantum
's
financial
future
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
When
a
plant
has
just
been
running
flat
out
to
meet
demand
,
calculating
lost
profit
and
thus
claims
under
business-interruption
insurance
is
straightforward
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
the
numbers
become
trickier
--
and
subject
to
dickering
between
insured
and
insurer
--
when
demand
is
shifting
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
You
say
you
could
have
sold
X
percent
of
this
product
and
Y
percent
of
that
,
''
recalls
Theodore
Semegran
,
an
analyst
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
who
went
through
this
exercise
during
his
former
career
as
a
chemical
engineer
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
And
then
you
still
have
to
negotiate
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
Quantum
hopes
the
Morris
plant
,
where
limited
production
got
under
way
last
week
,
will
resume
full
operation
by
year
's
end
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
plant
usually
accounts
for
20
%
to
25
%
of
Quantum
's
polyethylene
production
and
50
%
of
its
ethylene
production
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Not
everything
looks
grim
for
Quantum
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
plant
expansion
should
strengthen
the
company
's
sway
in
the
polyethylene
business
,
where
market
share
is
often
taken
through
sheer
capacity
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
By
lifting
ethylene
production
,
the
expansion
will
also
lower
the
company
's
raw
material
costs
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Quantum
is
also
tightening
its
grip
on
its
one
large
business
outside
chemicals
,
propane
marketing
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Through
a
venture
with
its
investment
banker
,
First
Boston
Corp.
,
Quantum
completed
in
August
an
acquisition
of
Petrolane
Inc.
in
a
transaction
valued
at
$
1.18
billion
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Petrolane
is
the
second-largest

<EOS>
<BOS>
The

Suburban

was
already

<EOS>
<BOS>
Still
,
Quantum
has
a
crisis
to
get
past
right
now
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Some
analysts
speculate
the
weakening
stock
may
yet
attract
a
suitor

A

taken
private
earlier
this

in

An

roughly

the

the

wo

RJR

The

the

One

RJR

``

The

the

<EOS>
<BOS>
The
U.S.
,
which

finalizing
its
steel-import
quotas
,
is
allocating
a
larger
share
of
its
steel
market
to
developing

newly
industrialized
countries
which
have
relatively
unsubsidized
steel
industries
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
U.S.
has
negotiated
a
significant
cut
in
Japan
's
steel
quota
,
and
made
only
a
minor
increase
to
the
steel
allotment
for
the
European
Community
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Brazil
,
similar
to
Mexico
and
South
Korea
,
is
expected
to
negotiate
a
somewhat
bigger
share
of
the
U.S.
market
than
it
had
under
the
previous
five-year
steel

,
which
expired
Sept.
30
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Brazil
and
Venezuela
are
the
only
two

n't
completed
steel
talks
with
the
U.S.
for

ending
Oct.
1
,
1990

<EOS>
<BOS>
In
recent
years
,
U.S.
steelmakers

supplied
about
80
%
of
the
100
million
tons
of
steel
used
annually
by
the
nation
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Of
the
remaining
20
%
needed
,
the
steel-quota
negotiations
allocate
about
15
%
to
foreign
suppliers
,
with
the
difference
supplied
mainly
by
Canada
--
which
is

included
in

Other

have
formal
steel
quotas
with

U.S.
,
such
as
Taiwan

Sweden

Argentina
,
also
have
supplied
steel
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Some
of
these
countries
have
in
recent
years
made
informal
agreements
with
the
U.S.
that
are
similar

quotas

<EOS>
<BOS>
The
Bush

earlier

year
said
it
would
extend
steel
quotas
,
known
as
voluntary
restraint
agreements
,
until
March
31
,
1992
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
also
said
it
would
use
that
two-and-a-half
year
period
to
work
toward
an
international
consensus
on
freeing
up
the
international
steel
trade
,
which
has
been
notoriously
managed

subsidized
and
protected
by

<EOS>
<BOS>
The
U.S.
termed
its

a

despite
the

Mexico
,
which

These

<EOS>

The

have

phenomenal

may
bring
their
superconcentrates
to

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
Cincinnati
consumer-products
giant
got
clobbered
two
years
ago
in
Japan
when
Kao
introduced
a
powerful

called
Attack

which
quickly
won
a

Retailers
in
Phoenix
,

,
say
P&G
's
new
powdered
detergent
--
to
be
called
Cheer
with
Color
Guard
--
will
be
on
shelves
in
that
market
by
early
November
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
P&G
spokeswoman
confirmed
that
shipments
to
Phoenix
started
late
last
month
.
<EOS>

She
said
the

will
study
results
from

<EOS>

Superconcentrates
are
n't
entirely
new
for
P&G
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
company
introduced
a
superconcentrated
Lemon
Cheer
in
Japan
after
watching
the
success
of
Attack
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
When
Attack
hit
the
shelves
in
1987
,
P&G
's
share
of
the
Japanese
market
fell
to
about
8
%
from
more
than
20
%
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
With
the
help
of
Lemon
Cheer
,
P&G
's
share
is
now
estimated
to
be
12
%
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
While
the
Japanese
have
embraced
the
compact
packaging
and
convenience
of
concentrated
products
,
the
true
test
for
P&G
will
be
in
the
$
4
billion
U.S.
detergent
market
,
where
growth
is
slow
and
liquids
have
gained
prominence
over
powders
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
company
may
have
chosen
to
market
the
product
under
the
Cheer
name
since
it
's
already
expanded
its
best-selling
Tide
into
16
different
varieties
,
including
this
year
's
big
hit
,
Tide
with
Bleach
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
With
superconcentrates
,
however
,
it
is
n't
always
easy
to
persuade
consumers
that
less
is
more
;
many
people
tend
to
dump
too
much
detergent
into
the
washing
machine
,
believing
that
it
takes
a
cup
of
powder
to
really
clean
the
laundry
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
the
early
1980s
,
P&G
tried
to
launch
here
a
concentrated
detergent
under
the
Ariel
brand
name
that
it
markets
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
the
product
,
which
was
n't
as
concentrated
as
the
new
Cheer
,
bombed
in
a
market
test
in
Denver
and
was
dropped
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
P&G
and
others
also
have
tried
repeatedly
to
hook
consumers
on
detergent
and
fabric
softener
combinations
in
pouches
,
but
they
have
n't
sold
well
,
despite
the
convenience
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
P&G
contends
the
new
Cheer
is
a
unique
formula
that
also
offers
an
ingredient
that
prevents
colors
from
fading
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
retailers
are
expected
to
embrace
the
product
,
in
part
because
it
will
take
up
less
shelf
space
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
When
shelf
space
was
cheap
,
bigger
was
better
,
''
says
Hugh
Zurkuhlen
,
an
analyst
at
Salomon
Bros
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
with
so
many
brands
vying
for
space
,
that
's
no
longer
the
case
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
If
the
new
Cheer
sells
well
,
the
trend
toward
smaller
packaging
is
likely
to
accelerate
as
competitors
follow
with
their
own
superconcentrates
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Then
retailers
``
will
probably
push
the
-LCB-
less-established
-RCB-
brands
out
altogether
,
''
he
says
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Competition
is
bound
to
get
tougher
if
Kao
introduces
a
product
like
Attack
in
the
U.S.
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
To
be
sure
,
Kao
would
n't
have
an
easy
time
taking
U.S.
market
share
away
from
the
mighty
P&G
,
which
has
about
23
%
of
the
market
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Kao
officials
previously
have
said
they
are
interested
in
selling
detergents
in
the
U.S.
,
but
so
far
the
company
has
focused
on
acquisitions
,
such
as
last
year
's
purchase
of
Andrew
Jergens
Co.
,
a
Cincinnati
hand-lotion
maker
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
also
has
a
product-testing
facility
in
California

<EOS>
<BOS>
Some
believe
P&G
's
interest
in
a
superconcentrated
detergent
goes
beyond
the
concern
for
the
Japanese
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
This
is
something
P&G
would
do
with

without
Kao

With
economic
tension
between

U.S.

worsening

many
Japanese
had
feared
last
week
's
visit
from
U.S.
Trade
Representative
Carla
Hills
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
They
expected
a
new
barrage
of
demands
that
Japan
do
something
quickly
to
reduce
its
trade
surplus
with
the
U.S.
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Instead
,
they
got
a
discussion
of
the
need
for
the
U.S.
and
Japan
to
work
together
and
of
the
importance
of
the
long-term
view
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Mrs.
Hills
'
first
trip
to
Japan
as
America
's
chief
trade
negotiator
had
a
completely
different
tone
from
last
month
's
visit
by
Commerce
Secretary
Robert
A.
Mosbacher
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.
Mosbacher
called
for
concrete
results
by
next
spring
in
negotiations
over
fundamental
Japanese
business
practices
that
supposedly
inhibit
free
trade
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
said
such
results
should
be
``
measurable
in
dollars
and
cents
''
in
reducing
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
with
Japan
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
Mrs.
Hills
,
speaking
at
a
breakfast
meeting
of
the
American
Chamber
of
Commerce
in
Japan
on
Saturday
,
stressed
that
the
objective
``
is
not
to
get
definitive
action
by
spring
or
summer
,
it
is
rather
to
have
a
blueprint
for
action
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
She
added
that
she
expected
``
perhaps
to
have
a
down
payment
...
some
small
step
to
convince
the
American
people
and
the
Japanese
people
that
we
're
moving
in
earnest
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
How
such
remarks
translate
into
policy
wo
n't
become
clear
for
months
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
American
and
Japanese
officials
offered
several
theories
for
the
difference
in
approach
betwen
Mr.
Mosbacher
and
Mrs.
Hills
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Many
called
it
simply
a
contrast
in
styles
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
some
saw
it
as
a
classic
negotiating
tactic
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Others
said
the
Bush
administration
may
feel
the
rhetoric
on
both
sides
is
getting
out
of
hand
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
some
said
it
reflected
the
growing
debate
in
Washington
over
pursuing
free
trade
with
Japan
versus
some
kind
of
managed
trade
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Asked
to
compare
her
visit
to
Mr.
Mosbacher
's
,
Mrs.
Hills
replied
:
``
I
did
n't
hear
every
word
he
spoke
,
but
as
a
general
proposition
,
I
think
we
have
a
very
consistent
trade
strategy
in
the
Bush
administration
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
Yet
more
than
one
American
official
who
sat
in
with
her
during
three
days
of
talks
with
Japanese
officials
said
her
tone
often
was
surprisingly
``
conciliatory

''
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
I
think
my
line
has

Mrs.

said
at

Saturday

<EOS>
<BOS>
``
I

painted

When

three

She
highlighted
exclusionary
business
practices
that

But
her
main
thrust
was
to
promote
the
importance
of
world-wide

open

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
She
said
the
trade
imbalance
was
mainly
due

quantitative
targets

<EOS>

At

``

The
oil

's
middling
profits
could
persist
through
the
rest
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Major
oil
companies
in
the
next
few
days
are
expected
to
report
much
less
robust
earnings
than
they
did
for
the
third
quarter
a
year
ago
,
largely
reflecting
deteriorating
chemical
prices
and
gasoline
profitability
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
gasoline
picture
may
improve
this
quarter
,
but
chemicals
are
likely
to
remain
weak
,
industry
executives
and
analysts
say
,
reducing
chances
that
profits
could
equal
their
year-earlier
performance
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
industry
is
``
seeing
a
softening
somewhat
in
volume
and
certainly
in
price
in
petrochemicals
,
''
Glenn
Cox
,
president
of
Phillips
Petroleum
Co.
,
said
in

<EOS>
<BOS>
``
That

for

he
added
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
did
n't
forecast
Phillips

results
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
securities
analysts
say
Phillips
will
be
among
the
companies
hard-hit
by
weak
chemical
prices
and
will
probably
post
a
drop
in
third-quarter
earnings
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
So

<EOS>
<BOS>
Typical
is
what
happened
to
the
price
of
ethylene
,
a
major
commodity
chemical
produced
in
vast
amounts
by
many
oil
companies
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
has
plunged
13
%
since

<EOS>
<BOS>
A
year
ago
ethylene
sold
for
33
cents
,
peaking
at
about
34
cents
last
December
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
big
reason
for
the
chemical
price
retreat
is
overexpansion
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Beginning
in
mid-1987
,
prices
began
accelerating
as
a
growing
U.S.
economy
and
the
weak
dollar
spurred
demand
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Companies
added
capacity
furiously
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Now
,
greatly
increased
supplies
are

the

is
stronger

and
domestic

Third-quarter

``

that

materialize

<EOS>
<BOS>
The

<EOS>

In

,
crude

<EOS>
<BOS>
Refiners
say

believe
gasoline

will
rebound
this

,
though
still
not
to
the
level
of
1988
's
fourth
quarter
.
<EOS>

During

Crude

turn

Prices

a

higher

<EOS>

it

<EOS>

``
We

this
year
,
''
said
Bryan
Jacoboski
,
an

at

<EOS>
<BOS>
That
will
translate
into

particularly
compared
with
last

when
oil

steadily
fell

<EOS>
<BOS>
While
oil

have
been
better

natural

have
been
worse

<EOS>
<BOS>
In

they
averaged
about
5

they
were
in
1988
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
main
reason
remains
weather
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Last
summer
was
notable
for
a
heat
wave
and
drought
that
caused
utilities
to
burn
more
natural
gas
to
feed
increased
electrical
demand
from
air
conditioning
use
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
This
summer
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
milder
weather
than
usual
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
We
've
been
very
disappointed

the
performance
of

prices
,
''
said
Mr.

,
Phillips

president
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
The
lagging
gas
price
is
not
going

assist

performance
as
many

expected

''
<EOS>
<BOS>
Going
into
the
fourth

,
natural

are
anywhere
from
8
%
to
17

lower
than
a

<EOS>
<BOS>
For

,
natural

<EOS>
<BOS>
To
make
its
point
,
it
is
challenging
the

to
explain
reports
that

have
supplied
the

with
sophisticated
computer-driven

exported

Although

The

<EOS>
<BOS>
Last

,
Mr.

moved
the

in
the

gradual

told

he
would
allow

While
corn

soybean
prices
have
slumped
well
below
their
drought-induced
peaks
of
1988
,
wheat
prices
remain
stubbornly
high
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
they
're
likely
to
stay
that
way
for

,
analysts

<EOS>
<BOS>
For
one
thing
,
even
with
many
farmers
planting
more
winter
wheat
this
year
than
last
,
tight
wheat
supplies
are
likely
to
support
prices
well
into
1990
,
the

say
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
if
rain
does
n't
fall
soon
across
many
of
the
Great

'
wheat-growing
areas
,
yields
in
the
crop
now
being
planted
could
be
reduced
,
further
squeezing
supplies
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Also
supporting

are
expectations
that
the
Soviet

will
place
substantial
buying
orders
over

By

U.S.
wheat

the
winter
wheat
now
being
planted
is
harvested
--

projected

drop

443

<EOS>
<BOS>
That

be
the

In
response
to
dwindling
domestic

,
Agriculture
Secretary
Clayton
Yeutter
last

said
the
U.S.
government
would
slightly
increase
the
number
of
acres
farmers
can
plant
in
wheat
for
next
year
and
still
qualify

<EOS>
<BOS>
The

estimates
that
the
new
plan
will
boost
production
next
year
by
about
66
million
bushels
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
now
estimates
production
for

at
just

2.6

2.04
billion

a

<EOS>
<BOS>
But
the
full
effect
on
prices
of
the
winter
wheat
now
being
planted
wo
n't
be
felt
until
the
second
half
of
next

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Until
then
,
limited

On

In

Such

The

it
feared

Late

been
a

U.S.
Department

However

Friday

erased

,
in

In
announcements

effectively

cast
serious
doubt

<EOS>

GM
is
under
intense
pressure

skidded

<EOS>
<BOS>
The

currently

100

Just
a

GM

the
eighth
U.S.
assembly
facility
to
close
since
1987

<EOS>
<BOS>
Now
,
GM
appears
to
be
stepping
up
the
pace
of
its
factory
consolidation
to
get
in
shape
for
the
1990s
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
One
reason
is
mounting
competition
from
new
Japanese
car
plants
in
the
U.S.
that
are
pouring
out
more
than
one
million
vehicles
a

at
costs
lower
than
GM
can
match
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Another
is
that
United
Auto
Workers
union
officials
have
signaled
they
want
tighter
no-layoff
provisions
in
the
new
Big
Three
national
contract
that
will
be
negotiated
next
year
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
GM
officials
want
to
get
their
strategy

reduce
capacity
and
the
work
force
in
place
before
those
talks
begin
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
problem
,
however

is
that
GM

moves
are
coming
at
a
time
when
UAW

the

decision
to
let
word
of
the
latest
shutdowns
and
product
reassignments
trickle
out
in
separate
communiques
to
the
affected

``

GM

Production

In

For
Ms.

the

matched
the

she
felt
living

Little

Rosie

Maybe
Lily
became
so

When

When
Justice
William
Brennan
marks
the
start
of
his
34th
year
on
the
Supreme
Court
today
,
the
occasion
will
differ
sharply
from
previous
anniversaries
of
his
tenure
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
For
the
first
time
,
the
83-year-old
justice
finds
his
influence
almost
exclusively
in
dissent
,
rather
than
as
a
force
in
the
high
court
's
majority
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
This
role
reversal
holds
true
,
as
well
,
for
his
three
liberal
and
moderate
allies
,
Justices
Thurgood
Marshall
,
Harry
Blackmun
and
John
Stevens
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
are
these
four
players
,
three
of
them
in
their
80s
,
ready
to
assume
a
different
role
after
88
years
,
collectively
,
of
service
on
the
high
court
?
<EOS>
<BOS>
Every
indication
is
that
the
four
are
prepared
to
accept
this
new
role
,
and
the
frustrations
that
go
with
it
,
but
in
different
ways
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Justices
Brennan
and
Stevens
appear
philosophical
about
it
;
Justices
Marshall
and
Blackmun
appear
fighting
mad
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
four
justices
are
no
newcomers
to
dissent
,
often
joining
forces
in
the
past
decade
to
criticize
the
court
's
conservative
drift
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
always
,
in
years
past
,
they
have
bucked
the
trend
and
have
been
able
to
pick
up
a
fifth
vote
to
eke
out
a
number
of
major
victories
in
civil
rights
and
liberties
cases
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Now
,
however
,
as
the
court
's
new
five-member
conservative
majority
continues
to
solidify
,
victories
for
the
liberals
are
rare
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
change
is
most
dramatic
for
Justice
Brennan
,
the
last
survivor
of
the
mid-1960s
liberal
majority
under
Chief
Justice
Earl
Warren
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
the
seven
Supreme
Court
terms
from
the
fall
of
1962
through
the
spring
of
1967
,
the
height
of
the
Warren
Court
's
power
,
Justice
Brennan
cast
only
25
dissenting
votes
in
555
cases
decided
by
the
court
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Last
term
alone
he
cast
52
dissenting
votes
in
133
decisions
,
with
the
contentious
flag-burning
ruling
as
his
only
big
victory
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
Justice
Brennan
foresaw
his
new
role
,
strongly
defending
the
importance
of
dissents
in
a
1985
speech
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
Each
time
the
court
revisits
an
issue
,
the
justices
will
be
forced
by
a
dissent
to
reconsider
the
fundamental
questions
and
to
rethink
the
result
,
''
he
said
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Moreover
,
in
recent
months
he
has
said
that
when
he
was
on
the
winning
side
in
the
1960s
,
he
knew
that
the
tables
might
turn
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
has
said
that
he
now
knows
how
Justice
John
Harlan
felt
,
a
reference
to
the
late
conservative
justice
who
was
the
most
frequent
dissenter
from
the
Warren
Court
's
opinions
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Associates
of
81-year-old
Justice
Marshall
say
he
was
``
depressed
''
about
the
court
's
direction
last
spring
,
but
is
feisty
about
his
role
and
determined
to
speak
out
against
the
court
's
cutbacks
in
civil
rights
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
We
could
sweep
it
under
the
rug
and
hide
it
,
but
I
'm
not
going
to
do
it
,
''
he
said
in
a
speech
last
month
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
,
like
Justice
Brennan
,
considers
dissents
highly
important
for
the
future
,
a
point
that
has
n't
escaped
legal
scholars
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Harvard
Law
School
Professor
Laurence
Tribe
says
there
is
a
``
generation-skipping
''
flavor
to
current
dissents
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
dissenters
in
the
Warren
Court
,
he
says
,
appeared
to
be
writing
for
the
short-term
,
suggesting
that
the
court
's
direction
might
change
soon
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
Brennan
and
Marshall
are
speaking
in
their
dissents
to
a
more
distant
future
,
''
he
says
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Justice
Blackmun
,
who
will
turn
81
next
month
,
also
seems
feisty
about
his
new
role
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Associates
say
he
takes
some
defeats
more
personally
than
his
colleagues
,
especially
attempts
to
curtail
the
right
to
abortion
first
recognized
in
his
1973
opinion
,
Roe
vs.
Wade
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Friends
and
associates
who
saw
Justice
Blackmun
during
the
summer
said
he
was
no
more
discouraged
about
the
court
than
in
recent
years
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
his
outlook
improved
after
successful
cataract
surgery
in
August
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
his
level
of
frustration
showed
in
a
recent
,
impassioned
speech
to
a
group
of
hundreds
of
lawyers
in
Chicago
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
concluded
his
remarks
by
quoting
,
emotionally
and
at
some
length
,
according
to
those
present
,
the
late
Martin
Luther
King
's
famous
``
I
Have
a
Dream
''
speech
from
the
1963
March
on
Washington
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Justice
Stevens
,
69
,
is
probably
the
most
philosophical
of
the
dissenters
about
his
role
,
in
part
because
he
may
be
the
least
liberal
of
the
four
,
but
also
because
he
enjoys
the
intellectual
challenge
of
arguing
with
the
majority
more
than
the
others
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
If
the
role
these
four
dissenters
are
assuming
is
a
familiar
one
in
modern
Supreme
Court
history
,
it
also
differs
in
an
important
way
from
recent
history
,
court
watchers
say

four
savings-and-loan

,
in

of
big

sick
thrifts
,
but
low
bids
prevented
the
sale
of
a
fifth

<EOS>
<BOS>
The
four
S&Ls
were
sold
to
large

was

the

the

Acquirers
paid

After

may
repudiate
the
rates
paid
by

previously
targeted
five
thrifts

quick
sales

In

the

said
it
wo
n't
increase
its

rates
in
1990
;
a
full

four-color
page
in
the

costs
about
$
120,000

<EOS>
<BOS>
However
,
because
the
guaranteed

base
is
being
lowered
,
ad
rates
will
be
effectively
7.5
%
higher
per
subscriber
,
according
to
Richard

<EOS>
<BOS>
Time
is
following
the
course
of
some
other
mass-circulation
magazines
that
in
recent
years
have
challenged
the
publishing
myth
that
maintaining
artificially
high
,
and
expensive
,
circulations
is
the
way
to
draw
advertisers
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
recent

Reader

Digest
,
New

Times
Co.
's
McCall

,
and
most
recently
News
Corp.

,
have
cut
their
massive
circulation
rate
bases
to
eliminate
marginal
circulation
and
hold
down
rates
for
advertisers
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Deep
discounts
in
subscriptions
and
offers
of
free
clock
radios
and
watches
have
become
accepted
forms
of
attracting
new
subscribers
in
the
hyper-competitive
world
of
magazine
news-weeklies
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
Time
,
as
part
of
the
more
cost-conscious
Time
Warner
,
wants
to
wean
itself
away
from
expensive
gimmicks
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Besides
,
Time
executives
think
selling
a
news
magazine
with
a
clock
radio
is
tacky
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
Giveaways
just
give
people
the
wrong

,
''
said
Mr.

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
That
perception
takes
the
focus
off
the

.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
Time
magazine
executives
predictably
paint
the
circulation
cut
as
a
show
of
strength
and
actually
a
benefit
to
advertisers
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
What
we
are
doing
is
screening
out
the

who
are
only
casually
related

really
read
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Heinemann
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
We
are
trying
to
create
quality
and
involvement
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
However
,
Time
executives
used
the
same
explanation
when
in
October
1988
the
magazine
cut
its
guaranteed
circulation
from
4.6
million
to
4.3
million
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
Time
's
paid
circulation
,
according
to
Audit
Bureau
of

,
dropped
7.3
%
to
4,393,237
in
the
six
months
ended
June
30
,
1989
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Still
,
Time
's
move
is
being
received
well
,
once
again
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
It
's
terrific
for

to
know
the
reader
will
be
paying
more

''
said
Michael

,
national

director
at
Bozell

ad

<EOS>
<BOS>
``
A
few
drops
in

are

<EOS>
<BOS>
It

they
are
improving
the
quality
of

insuring
their

.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.
Heinemann
said
the
changes
represent
a
new
focus
in
the
magazine
industry
:
a
magazine
's
net
revenue
per
subscriber
,
or
the
actual
revenue
from
subscribers
after
discounts
and
the
cost
of
premiums
have
been
stripped
away
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
The
question
is
how
much
are
we
getting
from
each
reader
,
''
said
Mr.
Heinemann
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Time
's
rivals
news-weeklies
,
Washington
Post
Co.
's
Newsweek
and
U.S.
News
&
World
Report
,
are
less
reliant
on
electronic
giveaways
,
and
in
recent
years
both
have
been
increasing
their
circulation
rate
bases
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Both
magazines
are
expected
to
announce
their
ad
rates
and
circulation
levels
for

within

When
the

broke

in

two

,
Sen.

for

<EOS>
<BOS>
``

''
he
told

<EOS>
<BOS>
That
shows
how
far
Ted

's
Cable
News
Network
has
come
since
its
birth
nine
years
ago
,
when
it
was
considered
the
laughingstock
of
television
news
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
is
bigger
,
faster
and
more
profitable
than
the
news
divisions
of
any
of
the
three
major
broadcast
networks
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Its
niche
as
the
``
network
of
record
''
during
major
crises
draws
elite
audiences
around
the
world
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
for
all
its
success
,
CNN
has
hit
a
plateau
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Although
viewership
soars
when
big
news
breaks
,
it
ebbs
during
periods
of
calm
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
CNN
executives
worry
that
the
network
's
punchy
but
repetitive
news
format
may
be
getting
stale
and
wo
n't
keep
viewers
coming
back
as
the
alternatives
multiply
for
news
and
information
on
cable-TV
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
Just
the
fact
we

<EOS>
<BOS>
``

<EOS>
<BOS>
So
CNN
,
a
unit
of
Atlanta-based
Turner
Broadcasting
System
Inc.
,
is
trying
to
reposition
itself
as
a
primary
channel
,
or
what
people
in
the
television
industry
call
a
``
top
of
mind
''
network
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Tonight
,
to
kick
off
the
effort
,
CNN
will
premiere
its
first
prime-time
newscast
in
years
,
an
hourlong
show
at
6
p.m
.
Eastern
time
to
air
head-to-head
against
the
network
newscasts
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
show
will
be
co-anchored
by
Bernard
Shaw
and
Catherine
Crier
,
a
34-year-old
former
Texas
judge
and
campus
beauty
queen
who
has
never
held
a
job
in
television
or
journalism
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
new
show
is
perhaps
the
boldest
in
a
number
of
steps
the
network
is
taking
to
build
audience
loyalty
by
shifting
away
from
its
current
format
toward
more
full-length
``
signature
''
programming
with
recognizable
stars
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
To
distinguish
itself
,
CNN
is
also
expanding
international
coverage
and
adding
a
second
global-news
program
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
is
paying
higher
salaries
--
after
years
of
scrimping
--
to
lure
and
keep
experienced
staffers
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
it
is
embarking
on
an
expensive
gamble
to
break
major
stories
with
a
large
investigative-reporting
team
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
The
next
stage
is
to
get
beyond
the
opinion
leaders
who
use
us
as
a
point
of
reference
to
become
a
point
of
reference
at
ordinary
dinner
tables
,
''
says
Jon
Petrovich
,
executive
vice
president
of
Headline
News
,
CNN
's
sister
network
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
that
wo
n't
be
easy
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Networks
,
like
other
consumer
products
,
develop
images
in
peoples
'
minds
that
are
n't
easy
to
change
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
also
takes
money
that
CNN
has
been
reluctant
to
spend
to
make
programs
and
hire
talent
that
viewers
will
tune
in
specially
to
see
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
the
cable-TV
operators
--
CNN
's
distributors
and
part
owners
--
like
things
just
the
way
they
are
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
repositioning
bid
is
aimed
at
CNN
's
unsteady
viewership
--
and
what
may
happen
to
it
as
the
cable-TV
news
market
grows
more
competitive
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Already
,
CNN
is
facing
stronger
competition
from
Financial
News
Network
Inc.
and
General
Electric
Co.
's
Consumer
News
and
Business
Channel
,
both
of
which
are
likely
to
pursue
more
general
news
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
addition
,
many
cable-TV
systems
themselves
are
airing
more
local
and
regional
news
programs
produced
by
local
broadcast
stations
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
CNN
wants
to
change
its
viewers
'
habits
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Its
watchers
are
,
on
the
whole
,
a
disloyal
group
of
channel-zapping
``
grazers
''
and
news
junkies
,
who
spend
an
average
of
just
26
minutes
a
day
watching
CNN
,
according
to
audience
research
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
That
's
less
than
one-third
the
time
that
viewers
watch
the
major
broadcast
networks
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
brief
attention
viewers
give
CNN
could
put
it
at
a
disadvantage
as
ratings
data
,
and
advertising
,
become
more
important
to
cable-TV
channels
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
CNN
's
viewer
habits
have
been
molded
by
its
format
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Its
strategy
in
the
past
has
been
to
serve
as
a
TV
wire
service
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
focused
on
building
up
its
news
bureaus
around
the
world
,
so
as
events
took
place
it
could
go
live
quicker
and
longer
than
other
networks
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
filled
its
daily
schedule
with
newscasts
called
``
Daybreak
,
''
``
Daywatch
,
''
``
Newsday
,
''
and
``
Newsnight
,
''
but
the
shows
varied
little
in
content
,
personality
or
look
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Now
,
the
push
is
on
for
more-distinctive
shows
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
Our
goal
is
to
create
more
programs
with
an
individual
identity
,
''
says
Paul
Amos
,
CNN
executive
vice
president
for
programming
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Accordingly
,
CNN
is
adding
a
world-affairs
show
in
the
morning
because
surveys
show
its
global-news
hour
in
the
afternoon
is
among
its
most
``
differentiated
''
programs
in
viewers
'
minds
,
says
Mr.
Amos
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
it
is
exploring
other
original
programs
,
similar
to
its
``
Larry
King
Live
''
and
``
Crossfire
''
talk
shows
,
which
executives
hope
will
keep
people
tuned
in
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Then
there
's
``
The

''
the
prime-time
newscast
featuring
Mr.
Shaw
and
Ms.

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Until
now
,
CNN
has
featured
its
Hollywood
gossip
show
during
the
key
evening
period
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
70
%
of
the
cable-television-equipped
households
that
watch

do
so
between
6:30
p.m.
and
7
p.m.
,
the
network
discovered
,
so
CNN
wants
in
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.

says
the
Shaw-Crier
team
will
probably
do
two
live
interviews
a
day
,
with
most
of
the

,
at
least
for
now
,
appearing
similar
to
CNN

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Some
in
the
industry
are
skeptical
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
I

it

The

for
its
big
push
into
investigative

<BOS>
In

the

<EOS>
<BOS>
She
's
assembling

about
35
investigative
reporters
who
will
produce
weekly
,
in-depth
segments
,
with
an
eye

breaking
big
stories

<EOS>
<BOS>
CNN
executives
hope
the
headlines
created
by
such
scoops
will
generate
excitement
for
its
``
branded
''
programs
,
in
the
way
``

did
so
well
for
CBS
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
That
's
such
a
departure
from
the
past
that
many
in
the
industry
are
skeptical
CNN
will
follow
through
with
its
investigative
commitment

especially
after
it
sees
the
cost

producing
in-depth

CNN

Lawyers

claim
that
the

,
numbering

,
should
be
dismissed
as
moot
because
neither

<EOS>

CityFed

said
the

<EOS>
<BOS>
He

nonperforming

to
slightly
more

Approximately
85

CityFed
estimated

losses
in

<EOS>
<BOS>
CityFed
added
that
significant

Mr.

of

requiring
that

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
That
action
,
CityFed
said
,
will
result
in
a

against
third-quarter

of

<EOS>
<BOS>
CityFed
also
said
it

All
these

Mr.

In

saying
it

<EOS>

He
said
the

try

get

to
reverse
the

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
suspension
of
a

dividend
is
a
serious
step
that
signals
that
regulators
have
deep
concerns
about
an
institution
's
health
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
March
,
regulators
labeled
CenTrust
a
``
troubled

,
''
largely
because
of
its
big
junk-bond
holdings
and
its
operating
losses
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
the

month
,
the
Office
of

ordered
the
institution
to
stop
paying
common

dividends
until
its
operations
were
on

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
For

<EOS>
<BOS>
CenTrust

<EOS>
<BOS>
Since

<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.

only
about

150

are
tradeable
securities
registered
with
the

Exchange
Commission
.
<EOS>

The

he

are

CenTrust

over

<EOS>
<BOS>
The
Office
of
Thrift
Supervision
has
been
hounding
CenTrust
to
provide
current
market
values
for
its

,
but
CenTrust
has
said
it
ca
n't
easily
obtain
such
values
because
of
the
relative
illiquidity
of
the

and
lack
of
a

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Regulators
have
become
increasingly
antsy
about
CenTrust
's

other
thrifts
'
junk-bond

in

of
the

federal
thrift
bailout
legislation

the

<EOS>

<EOS>

In

Friday

Mr.

challenged
the

decision
,
saying
the
thrift

operating

``

junk-bond
losses
``
have
been
substantially
offset

<EOS>

He
also

substantial

for
possible

<EOS>
<BOS>
In

CenTrust
added
$
22.5

<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.

said
the
regulators
should
instead
move
ahead
with
approving
CenTrust
's
request
to
sell
63
of
its
71
branches
to
Great
Western
Bank
,
a
unit
of
Great
Western
Financial
Corp.
based
in
Beverly

,
Calif

<EOS>
<BOS>
The
branch
sale
is
the
centerpiece
of
CenTrust
's
strategy
to
transform
itself
into
a
traditional
S&L
from
a
high-flying
institution
that
relied
heavily
on
securities
trading
for
profits
,
according
to
Mr.
Paul
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Most
analysts
and
thrift
executives
had
expected
a
decision
on
the
proposed
transaction
,
which
was
announced
in
July
,
long
before
now
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Many
interpret
the

an
indication

are
skeptical
about

<EOS>
<BOS>
Branches

federal

<EOS>
<BOS>
CenTrust
,
however
,
touts
the
branch
sale
,
saying
it
would
bring
in
$
150
million
and
reduce
the
thrift
's
assets
to
$
6.7
billion
from
$
9
billion
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
said
the
sale
would
give
it
positive
tangible
capital
of
$
82
million
,
or
about
1.2
%
of
assets
,
from
a
negative
$
33
million
as
of
Sept.
30
,
thus
bringing
CenTrust
close
to
regulatory
standards
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
CenTrust
said
the
branch
sale
would
also
reduce
the
company
's
large
amount
of
good
will
by
about
$
180
million
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Critics
,
however
,
say
the
branch
sale
will
make
CenTrust
more
dependent
than
ever
on
brokered
deposits
and
junk
bonds
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.
Paul
counters
that
he
intends
to
further
pare
the
size
of
CenTrust
by
not
renewing
more
than
$
1
billion
of
brokered
certificates
of
deposit
when
they
come
due

The
thrift
is
also
working
to
unload
its
junk-bond
portfolio

continuing
to
sell
off

plans

While
some

is
the

here
many
believe
that
its
absence
is
to
blame
for
the
European

industry
's
sluggish
development
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Until
recently
,
national
governments
in
Europe
controlled
most
of
the
air
time
and
allowed
little
or
no
advertising
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Since
production
costs
were
guaranteed
,
it
did
n't
matter
that
a
program
could
n't
be
sold
abroad
or
put
into
syndication
,
as
most
American
programs
are
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
not
much
money
was
spent
on
the
shows
,
either
,
a
situation
that
encouraged
cheap-to-make
talk
and
game
shows
,
while
discouraging
expensive-to-produce
dramas
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Now
,
however
,
commercial
channels
are
coming
to
most
European
countries
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
satellite
and
cable
technology
is
spreading
rapidly
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Just
last
week
,
Greece
authorized
two
commercial
channels
for
the
first
time
;
Spain
earlier
began
to
allow
commercial

<EOS>
<BOS>
The
result
is
a
new

huge
appetite
for

<EOS>
<BOS>
But
perhaps
to
the
consternation
of
those
calling
for
quotas
,
most
of
this
void
is
likely
to
be
filled
with
the
cheapest

The

After

The

<EOS>

Most

Yesterday

<EOS>
<BOS>
Companies
with

But
it

bid
,
the

indicated
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
GEC
plans
first

merged
last

<EOS>
<BOS>
Also
,
any
GEC
bid
might
be
blocked
by
British
antitrust
regulators
;
Ferranti
is
GEC
's
main
competitor
on
several
key
defense-electronics

,
and
its
purchase
by
GEC
may
heighten
British
Defense
Ministry
worries
about
concentration
in
the
country
's
defense

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
consortium
bid
,
however
,
would
diminish
GEC
's
direct
role
in
Ferranti
and
might
consequently
appease

officials
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
<BOS>
For
both
Thomson

from
increasingly
tight-fisted
defense
ministries
;
and
Middle

,
a

<EOS>
<BOS>
The

<EOS>
<BOS>
Thomson
feels
the

on
building
cooperation

The

to

revised

,
8
%
lower

``
The

the

Mr.

the

western
Canada

Interprovincial

Canada

Mr.

said
Canada
's
declining
crude

,
combined

Under

Last

<EOS>

Microsoft

surprising

is
one

of
the
difficulty
facing

looking
for
reassurances
about

<EOS>
<BOS>
``
It

<EOS>

``
The

<EOS>

To

Mr.

said
that

half

earnings
below

Another
contradictory
message
comes
from
Businessland
Inc.
,
a
computer
retailer
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
July
,
the
company
reported
that
booming
sales
of
new
personal
computers
from
Apple

IBM
had
resulted
in
net

more

doubling
for
its
fourth

ended
June
30
to
$
7.4
million
,
or
23

a

<EOS>
<BOS>
This

,
however
,
Businessland
warned
investors
that
results
for
its
first
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
had
n't
met
expectations
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
company
said
it
expects
earnings
of
14
to
17
cents
a
share
,
down
from
25
cents
a
share
in
the

<EOS>

While
the
earnings
picture
confuses

say
the
major

In

<EOS>

Until

for
image

but
last

Apple

Adobe

biggest

Microsoft
rebelled

<EOS>
<BOS>
Now
the
two

are
collaborating
on
an
alternative

they
are

<EOS>

The
short-term

appears
strong

<EOS>

appearing

-LRB-

<EOS>
<BOS>
Not
only
is
Mr.

the
star
of
``

,
''
he
's
also
the
inheritor
of
a
comedic
tradition
dating
back
to
``
Duck
Soup

''
and
he
's
currently
a
man
in
hot
water

<EOS>
<BOS>
Here
,
in
neutral
language
,
is
the
gist
of
Mr.
Mason
's
remarks
,
quoted
first
in
the
Village
Voice
while
he
was
a
paid
spokesman
for
the
Rudolph
Giuliani
mayoral
campaign
,
and
then
in
Newsweek
after
he
and
the
campaign
parted
company
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.
Mason
said
that
many
Jewish
voters
feel
guilty
toward
blacks
,
so
they
support
black
candidates
uncritically
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
said
that
many
black
voters
feel
bitter
about
racial
discrimination
,
so
they
,
too
,
support
black
candidates
uncritically
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
said
that
Jews
have
contributed
more
to
black
causes
over
the
years
than
vice
versa
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Of
course
,
Mr.
Mason
did
not
use
neutral
language
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
As
a
practitioner
of
ethnic
humor
from
the
old
days
on
the
Borscht
Belt
,
live
television
and
the
nightclub
circuit
,
Mr.
Mason
instinctively
reached
for
the
vernacular
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
said
Jews
were
``
sick
with
complexes
''
;
and
he
called
David
Dinkins
,
Mr.
Giuliani
's
black
opponent
,
``
a
fancy
shvartze
with
a
mustache
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
If
Mr.
Mason
had
used
less
derogatory
language
to
articulate
his
amateur
analysis
of
the
voting
behavior
of
his
fellow
New
Yorkers
,
would
the
water
be
quite
so
hot
?
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
probably
would
,
because
few
or
none
of
the
people
upset
by
Mr.
Mason
's
remarks
have
bothered
to
distinguish
between
the
substance
of
his
comments
and
the
fact
that
he
used
insulting
language
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
addition
,
some
of
Mr.
Mason
's
critics
have
implied
that
his
type
of
ethnic
humor
is
itself
a
form
of
racism
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
For
example
,
the
New
York
state
counsel
for
the
NAACP
said
that
Mr.
Mason
is
``
like
a
dinosaur
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
People
are
fast
leaving
the
place
where
he
is
stuck
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
These
critics
fail
to
distinguish
between
the
type
of
ethnic
humor
that
aims
at
disparaging
another
group
,
such
as
``
Polish
jokes
''
;
and
the
type
that
is
double-edged
,
aiming
inward
as
well
as
outward
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
latter
typically
is
the
humor
of
the
underdog
,
and
it
was
perfected
by
both
blacks
and
Jews
on
the
minstrel
and
vaudeville
stage
as
a
means
of
mocking
their
white
and
gentile
audiences
along
with
themselves
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
the
hands
of
a
zealot
like
Lenny
Bruce
,
this
double-edged
blade
could
cut
both
the
self
and
the
audience
to
ribbons
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
wielded
by
a
pro
like
Jackie
Mason
,
it
is
a
constructive
form
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Why
constructive
?
<EOS>
<BOS>
Because
despite
all
the
media
prattle
about
comedy
and
politics
not
mixing
,
they
are
similar
in
one
respect
:
Both
can
serve
as
mechanisms
for
easing
tensions
and
facilitating
the
co-existence
of
groups
in
conflict
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
That
's
why
it
's
dangerous
to
have
well-intentioned
thought
police
,
on
college
campuses
and
elsewhere
,
taboo
all
critical
mention
of
group
differences
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
As
Elizabeth
Kristol
wrote
in
the
New
York
Times
just
before
the
Mason
donnybrook
,
``
Perhaps
intolerance
would
not
boil
over
with
such
intensity
if
honest
differences
were
allowed
to
simmer
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
question
is
,
if
group
conflicts
still
exist
-LRB-
as
undeniably
they
do
-RRB-
,
and
if
Mr.
Mason
's
type
of
ethnic
humor
is
passe
,
then
what
other
means
do
we
have
for
letting
off
steam
?
<EOS>
<BOS>
Do
n't
say
the
TV
sitcom
,
because
that
happens
to
be
a
genre
that
,
in
its
desperate
need
to
attract
everybody
and
offend
nobody
,
resembles
politics
more
than
it
does
comedy
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
is
true
that
the
best
sitcoms
do
allow
group
differences
to
simmer
:
yuppies
vs.
blue-collar
Bostonians
in
``
Cheers
''
;
children
vs.
adults
in
``
The
Cosby
Show
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
these
are
not
the
differences
that
make
headlines
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
``
Chicken
Soup
,
''
Mr.
Mason
plays
Jackie
,
a
Jewish
bachelor
courting
Maddie
-LRB-
Lynn
Redgrave
-RRB-
,
an
Irish
widow
and
mother
of
three
,
against
the
wishes
of
his
mother
-LRB-
Rita
Karin
-RRB-
and
her
brother
Michael
-LRB-
Brandon
Maggart
-RRB-
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
's
worth
noting
that
both
disapproving
relatives
are
immigrants
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
At
least
,
they
both
speak
with
strong
accents
,
as
do
Jackie
and
Maddie
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
could
n't
be
more
obvious
that
``
Chicken
Soup
''
is
being
made
from
an
old
recipe
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
a
safe
one
--
imagine
if
the
romance
in
question
were
between
an
Orthodox
Jew
and
a
member
of
the
Nation
of
Islam
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Back
in
the
1920s
,
the
play
and
movie
versions
of
``
Abie
's
Irish
Rose
''
made
the
theme
of
courtship
between
the
assimilated
offspring
of
Jewish
and
Irish
immigrants
so
popular
that
its
author
,
Anne
Nichols
,
lost
a
plagiarism
suit
on
the
grounds
that
the
plot
has
entered
the
public
domain
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
it
has
remained
there
,
as
evidenced
by
its
reappearance
in
a
1972
CBS
sitcom
called
``
Bridget
Loves
Bernie
,
''
whose
sole
distinction
was
that
it
led
to
the
real-life
marriage
of
Meredith
Baxter
and
David
Birney
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Clearly
,
the
question
with
``
Chicken
Soup
''
is
not
whether
the
pot
will
boil
over
,
but
whether
it
will
simmer
at
all
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
So
far
,
the
bubbles
have
been
few
and
far
between
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Part
of
the
problem
is
the
tendency
of
all
sitcoms
,
ever
since
the
didactic
days
of
Norman
Lear
,
to
preach
about
social
issues
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
To
some
extent
,
this
tendency
emerges
whenever
the
show
tries
to
enlighten
us
about
ethnic
stereotypes
by
reversing
them
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
For
instance
,
Michael
dislikes
Jackie
not
because
he
's
a
shrewd
Jewish
businessman
,
but
because
he
quits
his
well-paying
job
as
a
salesman
in
order
to
become
a
social
worker
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Even
more
problematic
is
the
incompatibility
between
sitcom
preachiness
and
Mr.
Mason
's
comic
persona
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
best
moments
in
the
show
occur
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
-LRB-
and
occasionally
in
the
middle
-RRB-
,
when
Mr.
Mason
slips
into
his
standup
mode
and
starts
meting
out
that
old-fashioned
Jewish
mischief
to
other
people
as
well
as
to
himself
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
too
often
,
these
routines
lack
spark
because
this
sitcom
,
like
all
sitcoms
,
is
timid
about
confronting
Mr.
Mason
's
stock
in
trade
-
ethnic
differences
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
I
'm
not
suggesting
that
the
producers
start
putting
together
episodes
about
topics
like
the
Catholic-Jewish
dispute
over
the
Carmelite
convent
at
Auschwitz
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
That
issue
,
like
racial
tensions
in
New
York
City
,
will
have
to
cool
down
,
not
heat
up
,
before
it
can
simmer
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
I
am
suggesting
that
they
stop
requiring
Mr.
Mason
to
interrupt
his
classic
shtik
with
some
line
about
``
caring
for
other
people
''
that
would
sound
shmaltzy
on
the
lips
of
Miss
America

At

-RRB-
said
he
was
``
confident
''
that
any
House-Senate
agreement
on
the
deficit-reduction
legislation
would
n't
include
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
a
senior
aide
to
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
,
where
tax
legislation
originates
,
said
there
are
n't
any
``
plans
to
produce
another
tax
bill
that
could
carry
a
gains
tax
cut
this
year
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
One
obvious
place
to
attach
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
,
and
perhaps
other
popular
items
stripped
from
the
deficit-reduction
bill
,
is
the
legislation
to
raise
the
federal
borrowing
limit
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Such
legislation
must
be
enacted
by
the
end
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
Senate
bill
was
pared
back
in
an
attempt
to
speed
deficit-reduction
through
Congress
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Because
the
legislation
has
n't
been
completed
,
President
Bush
has
until
midnight
tonight
to
enact
across-the-board
spending
cuts
mandated
by
the
Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction
law
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Senators
hope
that
the
need
to
avoid
those
cuts
will
pressure
the
House
to
agree
to
the
streamlined
bill
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
House
appears
reluctant
to
join
the
senators
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
key
is
whether
House
Republicans
are
willing
to
acquiesce
to
their
Senate
colleagues
'
decision
to
drop
many
pet
provisions
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
Although
I
am
encouraged
by
the
Senate
action
,
''
said
Chairman
Dan
Rostenkowski
-LRB-
D.
,
Ill
.
-RRB-
of
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
,
``
it
is
uncertain
whether
a
clean
bill
can
be
achieved
in
the
upcoming
conference
with
the
Senate
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
Another
big
question
hovering
over
the
debate
is
what
President
Bush
thinks
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
has
been
resisting
a
stripped-down
bill
without
a
guaranteed
vote
on
his
capital-gains
tax
cut
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
Republican
senators
saw
no
way
to
overcome
a
procedural
hurdle
and
garner
the
60
votes
needed
to
win
the
capital-gains
issue
on
the
floor
,
so
they
went
ahead
with
the
streamlined
bill
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
Senate
bill
was
stripped
of
many
popular
,
though
revenue-losing
,
provisions
,
a
number
of
which
are
included
in
the
House-passed
bill
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
These
include
a
child-care
initiative
and
extensions
of
soon-to-expire
tax
breaks
for
low-income
housing
and
research-and-development
expenditures
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Also
missing
from
the
Senate
bill
is
the
House
's
repeal
of
a
law
,
called
Section
89
,
that
compels
companies
to
give
rank-and-file
workers
comparable
health
benefits
to
top
paid
executives
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
One
high-profile
provision
that
was
originally
in
the
Senate
bill
but
was
cut
out
because
it
lost
money
was
the
proposal
by
Chairman
Lloyd
Bentsen
-LRB-
D.
,
Texas
-RRB-
of
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
to
expand
the
deduction
for
individual
retirement
accounts
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.
Bentsen
said
he
hopes
the
Senate
will
consider
that
measure
soon
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
To
the
delight
of
some
doctors
,
the
bill
dropped
a
plan
passed
by
the
Finance
Committee
that
would
have
overhauled
the
entire
physician-reimbursement
system
under
Medicare
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
To
the
detriment
of
many
low-income
people
,
efforts
to
boost
Medicaid
funding
,
especially
in
rural
areas
,
also
were
stricken
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Asked
why
senators
were
giving
up
so
much
,
New
Mexico
Sen.
Pete
Domenici
,
the
ranking
Republican
on
the
Senate
Budget
Committee
,
said
,
``

<BOS>

just
gone

''
<EOS>
<BOS>
Sen.
Dole
said
that
the
move
required
sacrifice
by
every
senator
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
worked
,
others
said
,
because
there
were
no
exceptions
:
all
revenue-losing
provisions
were
stricken
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
Senate
also
dropped
a
plan
by
its
Finance
Committee
that
would
have
increased
the
income
threshold
beyond
which
senior
citizens
have
their
Social
Security
benefits
reduced
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
addition
,
the
bill
dropped
a
plan
to
make
permanent
a
3
%
excise
tax
on
long-distance
telephone
calls
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
no
longer
includes
a
plan
that
would
have
repealed
what
remains
of
the
completed-contract
method
of
accounting
,
which
is
used
by
military
contractors
to
reduce
their
tax
burden
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
also
drops
a
provision
that
would
have
permitted
corporations
to
use
excess
pension
funds
to
pay
health
benefits
for
current
retirees
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Also
stricken
was
a
fivefold
increase
in
the
maximum
Occupational
Safety
and
Health
Administration
penalties
,
which
would
have
raised
$
65
million
in
fiscal
1990
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
provision
that
would
have
made
the
Social
Security
Administration
an
independent
agency
was
excised
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
approval
of
the
Senate
bill
was

sweet
for
Sen.

,
who
had
proposed
the
streamlining

<EOS>

's
relations
with
Budget
Director
Darman

who
pushed
for
a
capital-gains
cut
to
be
added
to
the

,
have
been
strained
since
Mr.
Darman
chose
to
bypass
the

other

earlier

off
several
major

<EOS>
<BOS>
Unlike

been
falling
this

<EOS>
<BOS>
Unlike
1987
,
the

strong

<BOS>
And
unlike
1987
,
the
economy
does
n't
appear
to
be
in
any
danger
of
overheating
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
the
economy
's
slower
growth
this

also
means
the
outlook
for
corporate
profits
``
is
n't
good

it

Renaissance

That

speak

which
he
quotes
from
the
transcript

<EOS>

He
did
repeat
those
nice
platitudes
several
times

an
indication

his
support

He
used
about
56
words
defending
the

constitutional
rights

<EOS>
<BOS>
Unfortunately
,
by
my
rough
guess
,
he
used
better
than
5,000
words
heaping
scorn
on
the
witnesses
for
exercising
the
Fifth

He
sandwiched
his

large

No

responsibilities

<EOS>
<BOS>
But
if
his
explanation

motivation
is
true

why
is
his
investigation
so
oriented
as
to
identify
criminal
activity

<EOS>

Why
not
simply
questions
designed

Such

it

<EOS>

The

rightly
pointed
out

number

is
not
the
likes
of
Mr.

who
after
all
is
really
a
bit
player
on

the

quasi-parliamentary\/judicial

I
do
not

defend

<EOS>

But
I
think
the
kind
of
congressional

that
has
been
pursued
is
a
far
greater
danger
to
American
notions
of
liberty
and
freedom
than
any
incompetency
-LRB-
and
,
yes

maybe
criminality
-RRB-
within

could
possibly
generate

I
disagree
with
the
statement
by
Mr.

that
one
should
not
draw
an
adverse
inference
against
former
HUD
officials
who
assert
their
Fifth
Amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
congressional
hearings
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
Fifth
Amendment
states
in
relevant
part
that
no
person
``
shall
be
compelled
,
in
any
criminal
case
,
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
This
privilege
against
self-incrimination
precludes
the
drawing
of
an
adverse
inference
against
a
criminal
defendant
who
chooses
not
to
testify
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Thus
,
in
a
criminal
case
,
a
prosecutor
can
not
comment
on
a
defendant
's
failure
to
testify
nor
can
the
defendant
be
compelled
to
take
the
stand
as
a
witness
,
thus
forcing
him
to
``
take
the
Fifth
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
privilege
,
however
,
has
been
limited
in
accordance
with
its
plain
language
to
protect
the
defendant
in
criminal
matters
only
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
Supreme
Court
and
some
states
have
specifically
recognized
that
``
the
Fifth
Amendment
does
not
preclude
the
inference
where
the
privilege
is
claimed
by
a
party
to
a
civil
cause

Thus
,
in
a
civil
case
,
a
defendant
may
be
called
as
a
witness
,
he
may
be
forced
to
testify
or
take
the
Fifth
,
and
his
taking
of
the
Fifth
may
permit
the
drawing
of
an
adverse
inference
against
him
in
the
civil
matter
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
He
may
take
the
Fifth
in
a
civil
matter
only
if
he
has
a
good
faith
and
justifiable
belief
that
his
testimony
may
subject
him
to
criminal
prosecution
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Allowing
the
defendant
to
take
the
Fifth
in
a
civil
matter
is
not
based
on
a
constitutional
right

refuse
to
testify

harms
him
in

but
because
the
testimony
in

matter
could
be
unconstitutionally
used
against
him
in

subsequent
criminal
prosecution
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Absent
the
risk
of
such
prosecution
,
a
court
may
order
the
defendant
to
testify
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Thus
,
when
Mr.
Pierce
asserted
the
Fifth
in
a
noncriminal
proceeding
,
particularly
after
presumably
receiving
extensive
advice
from
legal
counsel
,
one
must
conclude
that
he
held
a
good-faith
,
justifiable
belief
that
his
testimony
could
be
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
subcommittee
,
Congress
and
the
American
public
have
every
right
to
draw
the
adverse
inference
and
to
concur
with
Mr.
Pierce
's
own
belief
that
his
testimony
could
help
convict
him
of
a
crime
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Drawing
the
adverse
inference
in
a
noncriminal
congressional
hearing
does
not
offend
the
Fifth
Amendment
shield
against
self-incrimination

In
academia
,
a
so-called
Friday
the
13th
effect
has
been
set
up
and
shot
down
by
different
professors
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Robert
Kolb
and
Ricardo
Rodriguez
,
professors
of
finance
at
the
University
of
Miami
,
found
evidence
that
the
market
is
spooked
by
Friday
the
13th
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
their
study
,
which
spanned
the
1962-85
period
,
has
since
been
shown
to
be
jinxed
by
an
unlucky
choice
of
data
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
the
'70s
,
the
market
took
falls
nine
times
in
a
row
on
Friday
the
you-know-what
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
the
date
tends
to
be
a
plus
,
not
a
minus
,
for
stocks
,
according
to
Yale
Hirsch
,
a
collector
of
stock
market
lore
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Another
study
found
that
the
82
Fridays
the
13th
in
the
1940-1987
period
had
higher
than
average
returns
--
higher
even
than
Fridays
in
general
,
which
tend
to
be
strong
days
for
stock
prices
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
On
the
only
other
Friday
the
13th
this
year
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
rose
about
four
points
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Professor
Kolb
says
the
original
study
,
titled
Friday
the
13th
,
Part
VII
,
was
published
tongue-in-cheek
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
a
similar
vein
,
he
adds
that
the
anniversary
of
the
1987
crash
and
Saturday
's
full
moon
could
have
played
a
part
,
too
,
in
Friday
's
market
activity
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
reminiscent
of
those
during
the
1987
crash
--
that
as
stock
prices
plummeted
and
trading
activity
escalated
,
some
phone
calls
to
market
makers
in
over-the-counter
stocks
went
unanswered
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
We

Whether

any

Nasdaq

less

Most
of
the
complaints
about

came
from

rather
than
individual
investors
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.
King
of
Robinson-Humphrey
and
others
were
quick
to
add
that
they
believe
the
problem
stemmed
more
from
traders
'
inability
to
handle
the
volume
of
calls
,
rather
than
a
deliberate
attempt
to

<EOS>

The
subject
is
a
sore
one
for
Nasdaq

its
market-making

criticized
two

following
complaints

Market

maintain
orderly
trading
when

occur

<EOS>
<BOS>
On

like
Friday
,
that
means
they
must
buy

from
sellers
when
no

else
is
willing

<EOS>
<BOS>
When

<EOS>
<BOS>
Two
years
ago
,
faced
with
the
possibility
of
heavy
losses
on
the
stocks
in
their
inventories
,
market
makers
themselves
began
dumping
shares
,
exacerbating
the
slide
in
OTC
stock
prices
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
On
Friday
,
some
market
makers
were
selling
again
,
traders
said
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
,
with
profits
sagging
on
Wall

since

,

have
kept
smaller

stockpiles
on

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Mr.
Tarantino
of
Hambrecht

said
some
prices
fell
without

``

In

the

<EOS>
<BOS>
Because
Nasdaq
's
trading
volume
has
n't
returned
to
pre-crash
levels
,
traders

OTC
market
officials
hope
the
damage
wo

``
We

''
lamented

<EOS>
<BOS>
More
troubling
is
the
prospect
that
the
overall
collapse
in
stock
prices
could
permanently
erode
the
base
of
small-investor
support
the
OTC

was
struggling

1987
crash

Mr.

It

take

To

Most

have
abandoned

widely
thought

worsened

<EOS>
<BOS>
Not

this

generate

In

,
the

The
West
German
retailer
ASKO
Deutsche
Kaufhaus
AG
plans
to
challenge
the
legality
of
a
widely
employed
anti-takeover
defense
of
companies
in
the
Netherlands
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
eventual
court
decision
could
become
a
landmark
in
Dutch
corporate
law
because
the
lawsuit
ASKO
plans
to
file
would
be
the
first
to
challenge
the
entire
principle
and
practice
of
companies
issuing
voting
preferred
shares
to
management-controlled
trusts
to
dilute
voting
power
of
common
stockholders
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Up
to
now
only
specific
aspects
of
these
defenses
have
been
challenged
,
though
unsuccessfully
,
ASKO
's
Dutch
lawyers
noted
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Should
the
courts
uphold
the
validity
of
this
type
of
defense
,
ASKO
will
then
ask
the
court
to
overturn
such
a
vote-diluting
maneuver
recently
deployed
by
Koninklijke
Ahold
NV
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
ASKO
says
the
Dutch-based
international
food
retailer
had
n't
reasonable
grounds
to
issue
preferred
stock
to
a
friendly
trust
and
thus
dilute
the
worth
and
voting
power
of
ASKO
and
other
shareholders
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Speaking
through
its
Dutch
lawyers
,
ASKO
also
disclosed
it
holds
a

stake

It

ASKO
held

stake

A

House

said

For
the
last
two
weeks
,
the
Bush
administration
and
the
Federal
Reserve
have
been
engaged
in
a
semi-public
battle
over
international
economic
policy
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
administration
has
been
trying
to
push
the
dollar
lower
;
the
Fed
has
been
resisting
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
One
of
the
things
that
continues
to

is
this
monetary
warfare
between
the

Department
and

Board
,

on

<EOS>

The
administration
has
sent
out
confusing
signals
about
its
response
to
a
recent
spate
of
airline
takeovers
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Last
month
,
Transportation
Secretary
Sam
Skinner
forced
Northwest
Airlines
to
reduce
a
stake
held
by
KLM
Royal
Dutch
Airlines
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
he
has
since
run
into
opposition
from
the
Treasury
and
the
White
House
over
that
decision
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
he
has
kept
mum
on
how
his
decision
might
affect
a
bid
for
United
Airlines
,
which
includes
a
big
stake
by
British
Airways
PLC
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Some
analysts
say
uncertainty
about
Washington
's
anti-takeover
policy
was
one
reason
that
financing
for
the
United
Airlines
takeover
fell
through
--
the
event
that
triggered
the
market
drop
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
many
ways
,
the
backdrop
to
Friday
's
stock
decline
is
eerily
similar
to
that
of
October
1987
's
508-point
crash
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Then
,
as
now
,
the
budget
debate
was
behind
schedule
and
automatic
spending
cuts
were
within
days
of
taking
hold
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
Treasury
was
locked
in
a
battle
over
international
economic
policy
,
although
at
that
time
it
was
with
West
German
officials
rather
than
the
Federal
Reserve
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
concern
about
official
actions
aimed
at
takeovers
--
then
by
the
tax-writing
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
rather
than
the
Transportation
Department
--
were
making
markets
nervous
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
1987
crash
brought
the
Reagan
administration
and
Democratic
lawmakers
to
the
table
for
the
first
budget
summit
,
resulting
in
a
two-year
plan
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
more
than
$
76
billion
--
even
though
the
deficit
actually
rose
by
nearly
$
12
billion
during
that
period
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
,
barring
further
drops
in
the
market
this
week
,
a
similar
outcome
does
n't
seem
likely
this
year
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Lawmakers
and
administration
officials
agree
that
Friday
's
drop
,
by
itself
,
is
n't
enough
to
force
both
sides
back
to
the
table
to
try
to
reach
a
deficit-reduction
agreement
that
would
be
more
serious
and
more
far-reaching
than
last
spring
's
gimmick-ridden
plan
,
which
still
is
n't
fully
implemented
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
One
of
the
biggest
reasons
that
new
talks
are
n't
likely
to
come
about
is
that
,
as
everyone
learned
in
1987
,
the
economy
and
the
market
can
survive
a
one-day
508-point
tumble
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
Everybody
thought
we
were
looking
at
a
repetition
of
1929
,
that
we
were
looking
at
a
recession
,
''
Rep.
Panetta
said
yesterday
in
an
interview
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
That
did
not
happen
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
They
learned
they
could
survive
it
without
much
problem
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
administration
officials
privately
agree
with
Mr.
Panetta
,
who
said
a
precipitous
drop
this
week
``
is
going
to
force
the
president
and
Congress
to
take
a
much
harder
look
at
fiscal
policy
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
that
case
,
there
will
be
plenty
of
blame
to
go
around
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
There
is
an
underlying
concern
on
the
part
of
the
American
people
--
and
there
should
be
-
that
the
administration
has
not
gone
far
enough
in
cutting
this
deficit
and
that
Congress
has
been
unwilling
to
cut
what
the
administration
asked
us
to
cut
,

said
Senate
Finance
Committee
Chairman
Lloyd

-LRB-

-RRB-
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Nevertheless
,
it
clearly
will
take
more
than
Friday
's
190-point
decline
to
overcome
the
bitter
feelings
that
have
developed
between
lawmakers
and
White
House
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
over
the
capital-gains
fight
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Hill
Democrats
are
particularly
angry
over
Mr.

's
claim
that
the
capital-gains
cut
was
part
of

accord
and
his
insistence
on
combining
it
with
the
deficit-reduction
legislation
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
There
is
no
prospect
of
any
so-called
grand
compromise
or

next

because

Senate

-LRB-
D.

said
yesterday
on

''
<EOS>
<BOS>
During
last

's
maneuverings
on
the
deficit-cutting
bill
and
the
capital-gains
issue
,
there
were
signs
that
Senate
Republicans
and
the

were
at
odds
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
At
the
very
moment
that
Senate
Republicans
were
negotiating
a
deal
to
exclude
capital
gains
from
the
deficit-reduction
legislation
,
White
House
spokesman
Marlin
Fitzwater
told
reporters
that
it
was
the
president
's
policy
to
include
it
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
When
an
agreement
was
reached
to
strip
capital
gains
from
the
legislation
,
Oregon
Sen.
Bob
Packwood
,
the
ranking
GOP
member
of
the
tax-writing
Senate
Finance
Committee
,
hailed
it
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Asked
if
the
administration
agreed
,
he
curtly
replied
:
``
The
adminstration
will
have
to
speak
for
itself
.
''
<EOS>
<BOS>
Friday
's
market
tumble
could
spur
action
on
reconciling
the
House
and
Senate
versions
of
the
deficit-reduction
measure
,
a
process
that
is
n't
expected
to
begin
until
tomorrow
at
the
soonest
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Senate
Republicans
expressed
the
hope
that
the
House
would
follow
the
lead
of
the
Senate
,
which
on
Friday
agreed
to
drop
a
variety
of
spending
measures
and
tax
breaks
that
would
have
increased
the
fiscal
1990
deficit
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
The
market
needs
a
strong
signal
that
we
're
serious
about
deficit
reduction
,
and
the
best
way
to
do

is
for
the

to
strip
their

The
White
House
Office
of

Budget
,
whose
calculations
determine
whether
the
Gramm-Rudman
targets
are
met
,
estimated
that
the
House-passed
deficit-reduction
measure
would
cut
the
fiscal
1990
shortfall
by
$
6.2
billion
,
almost
half
of
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
's
estimate
of
$
11.0
billion
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Rep.
Panetta
said
that
OMB
's
figure
would
still
be
enough
to
avoid
permanent
across-the-board
cuts

:
``

issued
a
statement
attributing
the

to
the
Senate
decision
to
postpone
action
on

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
Investors

The

<EOS>

Compaq

put

in

especially
Zenith
Electronics

,
the
current

leader
,
and
on
a

of
promising
start-ups
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Compaq
's
series
of
notebooks
extends
a
trend
toward
downsizing
in
the
personal
computer
market
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
One
manufacturer
already
has
produced
a
clipboard-sized
computer
called
a
notepad
,
and
two
others
have
introduced
even
smaller
``
palmtops

''
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
those
machines
are
still
considered
novelties
,
with
keyboards
only
a
munchkin
could
love
and
screens
to
match
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Compaq
's
notebooks
,
by
contrast
,
may
be
the
first
in
their
weight
class
not
to
skimp
on
features
found
in
much
bigger
machines
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Analysts
say
they
're
faster
and
carry
more
memory
than
anything
else
of
their
size
on
the
market
--
and
they
're
priced
aggressively
at
$
2,400
to
$
5,000
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
All
of
this
comes
in
a
machine
that
weighs
only
six
pounds
and
fits
comfortably
into
most
briefcases
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
recent
months
,
Compaq
's
competition
,
including
Zenith
,
Toshiba
Corp.
,
Tandy
Corp.
and
NEC
Corp.
all
have
introduced
portables
that
weigh
approximately
the
same
and
that
are
called
notebooks
--
perhaps
misleadingly
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
One
analyst
,
noting
that
most
such
machines
are
about
two
inches
thick
,
takes
exception
to
the
name
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
``
This

That

computer
introduced

by
GRiD

Corp.
,
a

<EOS>

Instead

the
ability

``

''
block
printing

<EOS>
<BOS>
At
4
1\/2
pounds
,
it
may
be
too

it
nevertheless
opens
up

Palmtops

Atari

,
introduced

two

and
in

weighs

runs
on
three
AA

,
yet
has
the
power
to
run
some
spreadsheets
and
word
processing
programs
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Some
critics
,
however
,
say
its
ability
to
run
commonplace
programs
is
restricted
by
a
limited
memory
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Poquet
Computer
Corp.
,
meanwhile
,
has
introduced
a
much
more
sophisticated
palmtop
that
can
run
Lotus
1-2-3
and
other
sophisticated
software
programs
,
but
costs
five
times

<EOS>
<BOS>
At

is
what
Mike

,
Compaq
's
president
of

operations
,
calls
``

of

the
search
for
``

so
small
you
can
take

everywhere

''
<EOS>
<BOS>
The

nobody
knows
yet
how

it
can
be

<BOS>
``

Consider

<EOS>

Laptops

generally
anything
under
15
pounds
--
have
become
the
fastest-growing
personal
computer
segment
,
with
sales
doubling
this
year
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Responding
to
that
demand
,
however
,
has
led
to
a
variety
of
compromises
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Making
computers
smaller
often
means
sacrificing
memory
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
It
also
has
precluded
use
of
the
faster
,
more
powerful
microprocessors
found
in
increasing
numbers
of
desktop
machines
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Size
and
weight
considerations
also
have
limited
screen
displays
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
competitive
sniping
can
get
pretty
petty
at
times
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
Poquet
spokesman
,
for
example
,
criticizes
the
Atari
Portfolio
because
it
requires
three
batteries
while
the
Poquet
needs
only
two
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Both
palmtops
are
dismissed
by
notebook
makers
,
who
argue
that
they
're
too
small
--
a
problem
Poquet
also
encountered
in
focus
groups
,
admits
Gerry
Purdy
,
director
of

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Poquet
,
trying

''
label
,
responded

line
,
``

''
<EOS>
<BOS>
Despite
the
sniping
,
few
question
the
inevitability
of
the
move
to
small
machines
that
do
n't
make
compromises
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Toward
that
end
,
experts
say
the
real
battle
will
take
place
between
center-stage
players
like
Toshiba
,
Zenith
and
now
Compaq
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Compaq
's
new
machines
are
considered
a
direct
threat
to
start-up
firms
like
Dynabook
Inc.
,
which
introduced
in
June
a
computer
that
,
like
Compaq
's
,
uses
an
Intel
286
microprocessor
and
has
a
hard
disk
drive
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
the
Dynabook
product
is
twice
as
heavy
and
costs
more
than
Compaq

<EOS>
<BOS>
Compaq
's
announcement
also
spells
trouble
for
Zenith
,
which
last
year
had
28
%
of
the
U.S.
laptop
market
but
recently
agreed
to
sell
its
computer
business

Zenith

will
vote

it
is
pegged

two-inch

<EOS>

John

president

simply
shrugs
off
such
criticism

noting

Investors
who
bought
stock
with
borrowed
money
--
that

,
``
on
margin
''
--
may
be
more
worried
than
most
following
Friday
's
market
drop
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
That
's
because
their
brokers
can
require
them
to
sell
some
shares
or
put
up
more
cash
to
enhance
the
collateral
backing
their
loans
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
October
1987
,
these
margin
calls
were
thought
to
have
contributed
to
the
downward
spiral
of
the
stock
market
.
<EOS>

Typically

a
margin
call
occurs
when
the
price
of
a
stock
falls
below
75
%
of
its
original
value
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
If
the
investor
does
n't
put
up
the
extra
cash
to
satisfy
the
call
,
the
brokerage
firm
may
begin
liquidating
the
securities

IBM

questions

that
large

previously
sought

unsuccessfully

<EOS>
<BOS>
It

forcing
the

Sharply

What

Tiny

The

also
began
to
decline
Friday
as
the
stock

's
plunge
caused
some

to
reassess
their
desire
to
invest
in

<EOS>
<BOS>
Treasury
officials
have
been
arguing
for
months
that
the
dollar
's
strength
was
out
of
whack
with
economic
fundamentals
,
threatening
to
extinguish
the
export
boom
that
has
sustained
manufacturers
for
several
years
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
market
drop
has
now
apparently
convinced
foreign
investors
that
the
Treasury
was
right
about
the
overpriced
dollar
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
modest
drop
in
the
dollar
--
only
a
modest
one
,
mind
you
--
would
be
welcomed
by
the
U.S.
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
That
was
n't
the
case
in
1987
,
when
the
dollar
was
so
weak
that
some
economists
and
government
officials
seriously
worried
that
it
might
collapse
,
producing
panic
among
foreign
investors
and
diminishing
the
flow
of
foreign
capital
to
the
U.S.
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Another
big
difference
between
1987
and
1989
is
n't
so
comforting
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
the
third
quarter
of
1987
,
the
economy
spurted
at
an
inflation-adjusted
annual
rate
of
5.3
%
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
consensus
among
economists
is
that
it
grew
a
much
more
sluggish
2.3
%
in
the
third
quarter
of
1989
,
which
ended
two
weeks
ago
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
plunge
in
stock
prices
``
is
happening
at
a
time
when
the
economy
has
already
slowed
down
,
''
says
economist
Lawrence

of
WEFA

a

<EOS>

``

Consumer

drop

``

be

sink

the

abated

two

``
We

Mr.

notes

<EOS>
<BOS>
The
more
a
company
relies
on
borrowed
money
,
the
greater
its
sensitivity
to
an
economic
slowdown
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
company
with
a
strong
balance
sheet
can
withstand
an
unanticipated
storm
;
a
highly
leveraged
company
may
end
up
in
bankruptcy
court
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
Fed
,
of
course
,
knows
that
very
well
--
hence
its
readiness
to
pump
credit
into
the
economy
this
morning
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
But
,
in
the
process
,
the
Fed
risks
reigniting
inflation
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Even
before
Friday
's
events
,
Harvard
University
economist
Benjamin
Friedman
was
arguing
that
the
Fed
wo
n't
be
able
to
live
up
to
its
tough
words
on
eliminating
inflation
because
of
its
responsibility
to
protect
fragile
financial
markets
,
banks
and
highly
leveraged
corporations
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
biggest
threat
on
the
economic
horizon
right
now
is
n't
recession
,
he
reasons
;
it
's
an
outbreak
of
uncontrolled
inflation
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
the
end
,
the
1987
collapse
suggested
,
the
economy
does
n't
move
in
lockstep
with
stock
prices
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
economy
does
,
however
,
depend
on
the
confidence
of
businesses
,
consumers
and
foreign
investors
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
panic
on
Wall
Street
does
n't
exactly
inspire
confidence
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
Surveys
suggested
that
consumer
confidence
was
high
before
Friday
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
A
190-point
drop
is
n't
likely
to
make
much
of
a
dent
;
multiply
that
a
few
times
over
,
though

and
it
will

<EOS>
<BOS>
If
the
reactions
of
executives
gathered
Saturday
at
Hot
Springs
,
Va.
,
for
the
Business
Council
meetings
are
typical
,
business
leaders
were
n't
overly
rattled
by
Friday
's
decline
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
And
if
foreign
investors
become
a
tad
more
cautious
--
well
,
the
dollar
's
recent
strength
suggests
that
the
U.S.
can
stand
it
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
On
the
bottom
line
,
the
most
comforting
fact
for
the
economic
outlook
is
that
we
've
been
through
this
before

<EOS>

Two
